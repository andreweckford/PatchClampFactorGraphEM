# CFTR
State estimation for CFTR using the sum-product algorithm

Use Python 3 with the Anaconda Python distribution. (Minimum requirements: numpy, matplotlib)

To run:

from main import main
main()

Default is 200 timesteps. To change the length of the simulation (for example, 1000 timesteps):

from main import main
main(1000)

To change the receptor parameters, edit the CFTR.py file.
