# PatchClampFactorGraphEM

This code generates the results from the paper "A factor graph EM algorithm for inference of kinetic microstates from patch clamp measurements".

Data used to generate figures, as well as a jupyter notebook to create the figures, are included in the "data-repository-and-figures" directory.
